My Project Overview
Welcome to my first project! This repository is a part of my learning journey, and here’s a brief overview of its structure:

bash: Contains scripts to automate tasks.

bash/best: A simple script that prints "This School is so cool!".
bash/school: A script that prints "The school is open!".
c: This folder will contain all C programming files.

c/c_is_fun.c: Placeholder for C code.
js: This folder will contain JavaScript files.

js/main.js and js/index.js: Empty for now, but soon to be filled with code.

Current Branches
main: The main branch for stable updates.
update_script: A branch created to isolate my feature updates and personal work.

Git Workflow
I’m following a branching workflow to ensure my code is organized and isolated for different tasks.
